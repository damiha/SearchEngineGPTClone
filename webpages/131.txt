Overall this article seems to be informative but there are a few areas I feel like the clarity could be improved. In particular, in the middle paragraph of the frescos of the upper church at Assisi are a bit confusing and then a sentence in the sequence section of the Scrovegni chapel about the faded blue color is oddly worded. Additionally, I feel like this article relies heavily on two or three sources of information with just bits and pieces of information from other sources. Although I understand that much of the information about Giotto's life is taken from Vasari's Lives of Artists, this information seems heavily debated and therefore it may be best to find a few more sources. Finally some sections seem to be missing citations entirely. For example, the style section fro the Scrovegni chapel has only one reference and the Stefaneschi TriptychIt section has no citations. It may be that this information is from a previously cited source in the article but it is not clear where this information is coming from.

The verbatim of the full Vasari quote is "Et insieme a Fiorenza inviatisi, non solo in poco tempo pareggiò il fanciullo la maniera di Cimabue, ma ancora divenne tanto imitatore della natura, che ne’ tempi suoi sbandí affatto quella greca goffa maniera, e risuscitò la moderna e buona arte della pittura, et introdusse il ritrar di naturale le persone vive, che molte centinaia d’anni non s’era usato." (i.e. from http://it.wikisource.org/wiki/Le_vite_de'_pi%C3%B9_eccellenti_pittori,_scultori_e_architettori_(1550)/Giotto)

Vasari would have not used Byzantine.  --Alessandro Riolo (talk)  20:47, 23 January 2011 (UTC)Reply[reply]

Is this really correct? It seems strange given that elsewhere Giotto is referred to as Cimabue's apprentice ? Or were there two Cimabues?  —Preceding unsigned comment added by 137.204.150.110 (talk) 15:47, 19 November 2007 (UTC)Reply[reply]

The article contains an annecdote about Giotto painting a circle to demonstrate his skill to a pope. Last night an anon IP with some history of vandalism
changed the numerals for the pope involved from Pope Benedict IX to Pope Benedict XI then Pope Benedict XII, without explanation. I would have
reverted, but I did a little checking first and it looks like there is a problem.        

Our original reference was to Pope Benedict IX and this is backed up by this website. But it has to be wrong, as that pope died around 1085 which is a couple of centuries before Giotto was born.

Popes Benedict XI and Benedict XII have dates which make them possible, but I can't find any web references that concur. 

The Webmuseum attributes the story to Vasari, and puts Pope Boniface VIII in the frame.

Has anyone got a more authoratative source - a book perhaps? - Solipsist 07:37, 21 Mar 2005 (UTC)

According to Vasari's Lives Of The Artists Volume I, it was Benedict IX. I wouldn't be surprised if it was innacurate, however being the definitive work on the life of Giotto I suppose it's at least definitively inaccurate. -209.174.140.100 01:50, 30 January 2006 (UTC)Reply[reply]

I remember this fellow's name from Dante, but I don't remember what transpired or where he was placed. Anyone remember? --24.51.94.14 04:32, 19 July 2006 (UTC)Reply[reply]

There is a reference to Giotto's earthly fame in Purgatory.  The lines in question talk about how Cimabue used to "hold the field"  as the most famous painter in Italy but now Giotto "has the cry" of the people. I intend to reword this entry altogether and I will include the quote when I do.  October 26, 2006

I've started an approach that may apply to Wikipedia's Core Biography articles: creating a branching list page based on in popular culture information.  I started that last year while I raised Joan of Arc to featured article when I created Cultural depictions of Joan of Arc, which has become a featured list.  Recently I also created Cultural depictions of Alexander the Great out of material that had been deleted from the biography article.  Since cultural references sometimes get deleted without discussion, I'd like to suggest this as a model for the editors here.  Regards, Durova 15:09, 17 October 2006 (UTC)Reply[reply]

{{helpme}}If there is any picture of Giotto's artwork when he painted a fly on it and it looked so realistic people shooed it away. let me know [[Wrestling Maniac]] 00:25, 10 April 2007 (UTC)Reply[reply]

I've read a few ago that in 1334, the Florence's Council proclaimed that. I need a page source for it. ( and also, any one could check the ortography and the grammar? thanks)  —Preceding unsigned comment added by 77.27.16.94 (talk) 13:42, 14 June 2008 (UTC)Reply[reply]

Is "Italian" appropriate, given that a complete "Italian" country was a few years off? Wouldn't "Florentine" make more sense? 68.39.174.238 (talk) 16:08, 6 September 2008 (UTC)Reply[reply]

No way! Giotto's time is still in the Middle Age! --81.174.44.128 (talk) 00:39, 8 March 2009 (UTC)Reply[reply]

I think it bares mentioning that Divinci was greatly influenced by giotto.
Divinci's most recognizable works are the "circle" of the vitruvian man and the deep unnatural shading of the Mona Lisa reminicent of Giottos figures in a scene from the Arena Chapel or Morning of St Francis in Bardi Chaple.

how about some other opinions on Giotto, like El Greco's? it appears a bit one-sided at least from a byzantine standpoint eh... 87.202.138.112 (talk) 19:15, 23 April 2011 (UTC)Reply[reply]

Was just reading an essay, actually on Duccio, which mentioned Giotto's experimentalism and his use of the "extreme oblique." I see nothing here about either. Wasn't Giotto's work also a major influence on the development of perspective in the visual arts? 108.48.94.155 (talk) 02:04, 19 November 2015 (UTC)Reply[reply]

According to this source it's "c. 1270".[1]

Encyclopedia Britannica is uncertain as well: (born 1266–67/1276)[2]. So I consider that the circa tag is proffered since we already have two major sources supporting it, basically.

The reason for the reversion is that the face in the foliage is probably a self portrait.    The statue, on the other hand, is 19th century and purely speculative. Amandajm (talk) 14:57, 29 February 2020 (UTC)Reply[reply]

Good morning, I am a student of the University of Bergamo and for my assignment of Heritage Studies and ICT [1] I have added some lines saying that Palazzo della Ragione has been declared part of a UNESCO World Heritage site and why. I am available in case of any questions or doubts. --MyaJourneyBoo (talk) 17:19, 17 August 2021 (UTC)Reply[reply]

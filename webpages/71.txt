Giotto di Bondone (Florence, 1266/7 â€“ 8 Januari 1337) ni kati ya wachoraji bora kutoka Italia, pamoja na kuwa mhandisi. 

Anahesabiwa kati ya wasanii walioandaa Renaissance, kwa kuachana na mitindo ya Bizanti na kuchora watu walivyo kweli.[1]

Upande wa dini, alikuwa Mkristo wa Kanisa Katoliki, tena mwanachama wa Utawa wa Tatu wa Mt. Fransisko.

Note: while reproductions of paintings at external sites are valuable, attributions may be misleading. Any website that shows, without question, the frescoes of the Upper Church of St. Francis of Assisi as being the work of Giotto, is ignoring modern scholarship on the matter. Any website that claims Giotto was placed in charge of the decoration of the Upper Church or was selected as the "most suitable" artist for its decoration is making a claim based on lack of evidence.
